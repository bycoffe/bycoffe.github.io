I was curious how BuzzFeed's popular personality quizzes calculate their results. In looking into how they work, I ended up creating a bookmarklet that lets you choose a quiz result and see the answers that would lead to it.

(Note that in many cases, more than one combination of answers can lead to the same result. This uses the first matching answer it finds.)</p>
