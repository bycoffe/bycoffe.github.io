    <p>Drag the following link to your bookmarks bar. Click it while on a quiz page to show a list of possible results: <a class="bookmarklet" href='javascript:(function(){var e=document.createElement("script");e.setAttribute("src","http://bycoffe.com/buzzcheat/buzzcheat.js");document.body.appendChild(e)})()'>BuzzCheat</a></p>

    <p>I was curious how BuzzFeed's popular personality quizzes calculate their results. In looking into how they work, I ended up creating a bookmarklet that lets you choose a quiz result and see the answers that would lead to it.</p>
    <p>(Note that in many cases, more than one combination of answers can lead to the same result. This uses the first matching answer it finds.)</p>
    <p>Examples of quizzes: <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/awesomer/what-state-do-you-actually-belong-in">What State Do You Actually Belong In?</a>; <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/alannaokun/what-font-are-you">What Font Are You?</a>; <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/justincarissimo/which-classic-rock-band-are-you">Which Classic Rock Band Are You?</a>.
    <p>This code makes certain assumptions based on a small sample of quizzes that might not be true for all of them. It may stop working at any time.</p>
