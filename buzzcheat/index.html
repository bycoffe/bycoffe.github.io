    <p>Drag the following link to your bookmarks bar, and click it to show a list of possible results: <a class="bookmarklet" href='javascript:(function(){var e=document.createElement("script");e.setAttribute("src","http://bycoffe.com/buzzcheat/buzzcheat.js");document.body.appendChild(e)})()'>BuzzCheat</a></p>

    <p>I was curious how BuzzFeed's popular personality quizzes calculate their results. In looking into how they work, I ended up creating a bookmarklet that lets you choose a quiz result and see the answers that would lead to it.</p>
    <p>(Note that in many cases, more than one combination of answers can lead to the same result. This uses the first matching answer it finds.)</p>
